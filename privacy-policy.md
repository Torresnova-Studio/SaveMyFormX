Privacy Policy for SaveMyFormX
Last updated: [April 14, 2025]

SaveMyFormX is a Chrome Extension that automatically stores your form input data locally on your device to prevent data loss.

What data do we collect?
The extension captures text entered into input fields of online forms, including text areas, checkboxes, and select dropdowns.

How do we use your data?
The data is stored only locally on your device using Chrome's local storage API. This means your data is never transmitted, shared, or uploaded to any external server or third party.

Why do we request these permissions?
SaveMyFormX requires the following permissions to function:

activeTab: This permission allows the extension to interact with the current tab when the user explicitly activates the extension (e.g., when clicking the extension icon). It enables the extension to gather form data from the page you are currently viewing.

storage: This permission allows the extension to save and retrieve form data locally in the browser's storage. Your data is stored in your device's local storage and is not accessible by any external entities.

scripting: This permission is necessary for injecting the content script (content.js) into the active tab to capture and restore form data.

These permissions are essential for the functionality of the extension, but they do not allow us to collect any personal or sensitive data beyond the form data you actively input into the forms.

Do we share your data?
No. Your data stays on your device. It is never uploaded, shared, or transmitted to any external servers or third parties. The extension does not send any information to us or anyone else.

How can you manage or delete your data?
You can manually delete the saved form data at any time through the extension popup. Simply click the "Clear Data" button in the popup to remove all saved data.

Do we collect any personal information?
No. The extension only stores data related to the form fields you enter. We do not collect, store, or have access to any personal information like your name, email, or any identifiable details unless you enter them into the form fields.
